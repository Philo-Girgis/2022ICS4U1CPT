Repository for Pico Park created by Alan, Jerry, and Philo.
Philo worked on the logic of the game while Jerry and Alan worked on the graphics side of things.

Pico Park is a game about teamwork.
Players are meant to communicate and work together to acheieve a common goal: winning.

There are Five Players and Five Levels.
The game is not full screen, but all panels are 1280 by 720 pixels.
There is a chat window for players to communicate.

The port number for the program is a set number, but players who wish to join a game will have to enter an ip address.
Note for hosts: only give your ip address to people you trust.

A lot of work was put into the application.
It may not be the offical Pico Park, but we hope it meets your expections.
